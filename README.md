# The-Effects-of-Public-Capital-Expenditure-on-State-Productivity-A-Panel-Data-Analysis

## Abstract

This paper provides an extension on the article Why Has Productivity Growth Declined? Productivity and Public Investment by Alicia H. Munell. We expand on Munell’s research by analyzing more recent socioeconomic data and testing for heterogeneity. The results of our analysis show that public capital investment has a larger impact for states with a higher GDP per capita, implying that investment into public capital may not be an effective strategy to increase GDP growth for low-income states.
