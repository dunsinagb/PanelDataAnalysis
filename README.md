## Abstract

This paper provides an extension on the article "Why Has Productivity Growth Declined?"

Productivity and Public Investment by Alicia H. Munell. We expand on Munellâ€™s research by analyzing more recent socioeconomic data and testing for heterogeneity. 

The results of our analysis show that public capital investment has a larger impact for states with a higher GDP per capita, implying that investment into public capital may not be an effective strategy to increase GDP growth for low-income states.
